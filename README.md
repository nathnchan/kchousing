# Housing Price Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains a statistical analysis of housing prices in Washington. The primary motivation for exploring the kc_housing dataset is my parents who planned to move to Washington State after my sister and I left for college. Learning about statistical computing in R as well as basic regression analysis through my education at the University of Michigan, I wanted to apply what I learned to a dataset. Luckily, I found an already relatively full dataset about King's County in Washington which allowed me to combine what I learned with a real world problem. 

Washington is a state known for its diverse landscapes, vibrant cities, and a strong economy. It offers a wide range of housing options, from urban apartments to suburban homes, and even rural properties. The decision to move to Washington involves various factors, and one of the most critical considerations is the cost of housing.

To make an informed decision about moving to Washington, it's essential to understand the housing market in the area, including factors such as price trends, location preferences, and the availability of different types of properties.

## Data Source

For this analysis, we have sourced a dataset containing information about housing prices in Washington. The dataset includes a wide range of variables, such as property location, size, age, and, most importantly, the price of each property.

The data is derived from reputable sources and has been cleaned and prepared for statistical analysis.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:

1. **Understand Price Trends**: To identify the trends in housing prices over time in various regions of Washington. This will help us gain insights into whether it's a good time to buy and what areas might be more affordable.

2. **Location Analysis**: Analyze the dataset to determine the best locations within Washington for different housing preferences, whether that's a city, suburban, or rural setting.

3. **Property Characteristics**: Explore how the price of housing is affected by factors such as property size, age, and amenities. This will provide insights into what type of property suits our needs and budget.

4. **Future Predictions**: Utilize statistical techniques to make predictions about future housing prices. This can assist in planning for budgeting and understanding the potential appreciation or depreciation of property values.

## Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using various statistical techniques, including data visualization, regression analysis, and other modeling methods. The findings will be presented in a clear and understandable manner, enabling my parents to make an informed decision about their potential move to Washington.
